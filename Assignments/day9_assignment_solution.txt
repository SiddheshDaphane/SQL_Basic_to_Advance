Note: please do not use any functions which are not taught in the class. you need to solve the questions only with the concepts that have been discussed so far.

1- write a query to find premium customers from orders data. Premium customers are those who have done more orders than average no of orders per customer.

with no_of_orders_each_customer as (
select customer_id,count(distinct order_id) as no_of_orders
from orders 
group by customer_id)
select * from 
no_of_orders_each_customer where no_of_orders > (select avg(no_of_orders) from no_of_orders_each_customer)

2- write a query to find employees whose salary is more than average salary of employees in their department


select e.* from employee e
inner join (select dept_id,avg(salary) as avg_sal from employee group by dept_id)  d
on e.dept_id=d.dept_id
where salary>avg_sal

3- write a query to find employees whose age is more than average age of all the employees.


select * from employee 
where emp_age > (select avg(emp_age) from employee)


4- write a query to print emp name, salary and dep id of highest salaried employee in each department 


select e.* from employee e
inner join (select dept_id,max(salary) as max_sal from employee group by dept_id)  d
on e.dept_id=d.dept_id
where salary=max_sal

5- write a query to print emp name, salary and dep id of highest salaried employee overall


select * from employee 
where salary = (select max(salary) from employee)


6- write a query to print product id and total sales of highest selling products (by no of units sold) in each category

with product_quantity as (
select category,product_id,sum(quantity) as total_quantity
from orders 
group by category,product_id)
,cat_max_quantity as (
select category,max(total_quantity) as max_quantity from product_quantity 
group by category
)
select *
from product_quantity pq
inner join cat_max_quantity cmq on pq.category=cmq.category
where pq.total_quantity  = cmq.max_quantity

solve below questions. You can write SQLs and verify on the platform itself.

Note : The platform supports only postgreSQL so there may be few diffrences in functions. Listing down some important diffrences:

SQL server -> postgreSQL
to extract a part of the date
datepart(day,order_date) -> extract (day from order_date)

to convert datetime/timestamp field to date or any other type of type casting 
cast(order_date as date) -> order_date::date
