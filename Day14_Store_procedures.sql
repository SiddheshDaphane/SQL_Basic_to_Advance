-- Creating a store procedure.


USE namasteSQL -- datbase that I am using. 
GO -- begins a new batch because to create a store procedure "CREATE PROC" must be first line in a batch. 
CREATE PROC spSalaryStat -- "spSalaryStat" is the name of the procedure. 
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT dept_id, AVG(salary) AS avg_dept_salary, SUM(salary) AS total_dept_salry
    FROM employee
    GROUP BY dept_id
END


EXEC spSalaryStat; --  Executing the created procedure.
